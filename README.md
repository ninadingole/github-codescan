# github-codescan

This repository contains code samples for github code scanning utility, this is a sample repository for my blog post:

[Github Code Scanning](https://iamninad.com/github-code-scanning/).

You can check the security tab of this repository to see how code scanning provides details about any security or coding error in the codebase.


> If you checkout the code, it will contain errors explicitly added for demo purpose 😛
